<h3>Technically, my name is Mathew.<br />You can call me Alec.</h3>
<p>My parents saw fit to give me the name Mathew Alexander Stueber&dash;Lomas, and then <em>never, ever call me that my whole life</em>. It&rsquo;s given me a few headaches over the years.</p>
<p>I attend Glendale Community College, where I will recieve an AAS in graphic design in Fall 2014. After that, I will be pursuing a BAS in web development at ASU Polytechnic.</p>
<p>Now that you know a little about me and how I work, I'd love to get to know you. Shoot me <a href="mailto:malec.slomas@gmail.com" target="_blank">an e&dash;mail</a> with an idea or <a href="http://twitter.com/malecslomas" target="_blank">tweet me</a> a picture of your lunch. Of course there&rsquo;s also <a href="#contact" class="direct">several other ways of contacting me</a>.</p>
