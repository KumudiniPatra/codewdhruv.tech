<h4>The Logo</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.lennysburger.com" target="_blank">Lenny&rsquo;s Burger</a> is an amazing burger shop located in my home of Phoenix, Arizona. Unfortunately, their image in recent years has become this creepy man&dash;baby with odd type that wouldn&rsquo;t be out of place on a bowling shirt (not that there's anything inherently wrong with that). When tasked to redesign the brand, my first move was to bring the logo back to the feeling of the <a href="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-cSQGiOrYHHY/T4IPtu2FHNI/AAAAAAALyg4/Bsw2QG3m0RQ/s0/Lenny%2527s%2BBurger%2BShop" target="_blank">original script logo</a>.</p>

<h4>The Identity</h4>
<p>My next step was to find a voice for the brand. The script was friendly, but if I took it the wrong direction, I feared it could come off as pretentious. To undercut that, I imbued the website and advertising with a tongue&dash;in&dash;cheek sense of humor. I also tried to make the paper menu feel like the kind you&rsquo;d see at any great local restaurant.</p>

<h4>The Website</h4>
<p>I had the good fortune of having both a web design and JavaScript choice project due at the same time as the identity. I took the oppurtunity to flex my development skills and create the website from the mockup I created for my graphic design class. You can view the website <a href="http://web.gccaz.edu/~matjp79201/art192/lennys" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
