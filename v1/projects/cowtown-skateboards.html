<h4>The Logo</h4>
<p>In the field of skateboarding advertising, minimalism as a style is something of an enigma (though it is certainly on the rise). This is certainly true at the smaller sizes as well, with local skateshops often resorting to a dense, texture&dash;ridden, and largely unaligned look. <a href="http://www.cowtownskateboards.com/" target="_blank">Cowtown Skateboards</a> mostly pulls off this look, but I decided to see what it would look like if they adopted a decidedly flatter look.</p>

<h4>The Ads</h4>
<p>This particular class was very advertising&dash;based. As a result, most of what I created for the Cowtown brand was advertisements.</p>
