<h4>The Collages</h4>
<p>One day, I came upon a vendor at my local antique mall selling old magazines. I immediately picked up around five issues of LIFE from the 1960&rsquo;s and scanned them at 600dpi. Eventually I started playing about with them, using them mostly as textures at first, and then as the focus later. This is the result of the latter round of experiments.</p>
