<h3>An Incomplete Manifesto</h3>
<h5><em>2009 - 2010 / Personal / Poster</em></h5>

<h4>The Posters</h4>
<p>I was tasked with creating three different designs based off of one of the points from <a href="http://www.brucemaudesign.com/4817/112450/work/incomplete-manifesto-for-growth" target="_blank">Bruce Mau&rsquo;s <em>An Incomplete Manifesto for Growth</em></a>. I became enamored with the idea of creating a whole poster series based off of the manifesto. So here is my very own, very incomplete manifesto.</p>
