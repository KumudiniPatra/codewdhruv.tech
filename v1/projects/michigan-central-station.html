<h3>Michigan Central Station</h3>
<h5>2011 / Client / Competition</h5>
<hr />

<h4>The Winner</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.savemichigancentral.com/" target="_blank">Michigan Central Station Preservation Society</a> is dedicated to, well, preserving the Michigan Central Station. In order to raise funds, they held a design competition for a T&dash;shirt design. I won that competition, though the shirts were unfortunately never printed.</p>
