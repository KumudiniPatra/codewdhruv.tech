<h4>The San Francisco Crest</h4>
<p>I was initially contacted by the <a href="http://www.sfh3.com/" target="_blank">San Francisco Hash House Harriers</a> to redesign their previous crest. The results of that were decidedly mixed, so I created an alternative to present them. They loved it.</p>

<h4>The BAR Anniversy Shirt</h4>
<p>Through the people I met at SFH3 (my father), I was contacted to create a shirt for another hash. This one was to celebrate their 50<sup>th</sup> run. BAR Hash uses the BART system in San Francisco to get to the runs, so I incorporated the BART map into an infographic-style design representing the amount of times they ran from each stop.</p>
