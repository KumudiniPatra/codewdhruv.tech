<h4>The Design</h4>
<p>Being (once again) fortunate enough to have two assignments overlap, I set out to build a portfolio that leveraged jQuery and AJAX to design my own portfolio. The first part of this was to create a design that looked good not only on traditional PCs but also on mobile devices.</p>
<p>The dropdown paradigm was something I settled on fairly early in the process. Once my main navigational theme was set, I needed to figure out how I wanted to represent the content. Something I&rsquo;m always interested in is the thought-process behind designs. So in addition to the images presented in a more traditional portfolio, I also decided to include a short blurb for each section of a design. E.g. I originally concieved the landing as a full&dash;screen slideshow of my favorite few projects, but I scrapped that idea in favor of something more lightweight to reduce page load times.</p>

<h4>The Code</h4>
<p>The second half, of course, was to actually make the thing <em>work</em>. I wanted to use AJAX to make the site feel more native, but I also wanted to use jQuery to make the process of creating the site easier for myself. One of the ways I did this was to process all of the links and figures in my source HTML to programatically load the content. I used the great <a href="http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/" target="_blank">Magnific Popup</a> to create the slideshows, <a href="http://koala-app.com/" target="_blank">Koala</a> to compile Sass &amp; minify CSS/Javascript, and <a href="http://fontawesome.io/" target="_blank">Font Awesome</a> for the icons. You can view all of the code on <a href="http://www.github.com/malecslomas/Portfolio" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
