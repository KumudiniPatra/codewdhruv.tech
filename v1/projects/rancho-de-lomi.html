<h4>The Wedding</h4>
<p>I was asked to design a poster for Yvette &amp; Mathew's wedding invite. We then followed up with several designs for wedding materials to compliment the invitation.</p>
<p>Yvette is an incredibly passionate horse veterinarian. For the table cards, she wished to assign each group a horse, raher than a number. The idea being that in looking for your table, you might also learn a little about your horse.</p>

<h4>The Crest</h4>
<p>Yvette &amp; Mathew (who may or may not be my stepmother and father, respectively) asked me to design a crest that reflected their combined heritages - a bed of tulips representing Yvette's Dutch origins, and a Mayan calendar reflecting Mathew's origins in Central America. The crest has become something of a branding element in the Lomas-Nout clan, with the icon appearing on beer &amp; wine glasses, running jerseys, and a tile on the entrance to their home.</p>
