<h4>The Needle &amp; The Thermometer</h4>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be straight up with you: my mother contacted me to do this job. When she first contacted me about it, I wasn&rsquo;t so sure about it. After she told me more about what the client needed (and just as importantly, insured me that I would have creative control) I agreed to create some illustrations for them. They ended up using both illustrations on various shirts.</p>
