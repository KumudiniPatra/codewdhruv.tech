<h3>Bell&rsquo;s Brewing</h3>

<h4>The Logo</h4>
<p><a href="http://bellsbeer.com/" target="_blank">Bell&rsquo;s Beer</a> is a craft brewery from Kalamazoo, Michigan (loacated in nearby Comstock now). However, their current logo looks, to me, oddly Spanish. When I was tasked with redesigning the company&rsquo;s identity, the first thing I decided was to make use of the pride they take in being a Michigan&dash;based company. So I created the mitten-bell.</p>

<h4>The Brands</h4>
<p>Bell&rsquo;s treats each brew as it&rsquo;s own brand. I thought that was a clever solution to the problem many breweries face when they brew as diverse a range of beers as Bell&rsquo;s. However, I decided to try and make these different brands feel part of a cohesive whole through line-thickness and the use of the mitten-bell as a design element. Each brand receives it&rsquo;s own spot color, and each label is a screenprinted version of the brand crest.</p>

<h4>The Collateral</h4>
<p>In addition to the brands, I created an advertisement and a wesite mockup for this reimagined Bell&rsquo;s. The Bell&rsquo;s website is constantly updated, and places a large emphasis on events taking place at both Bell&rsquo;s own Eccentric Caf&eacute; and others in the region related to the brewery. I took these consideratons in mind and created a light, readable website that is easily updated, either manually or with a CMS.</p>
