<h4>The Script</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/ilovesweetsauce" target="_blank">Sweet Sauce</a> had never really had it&rsquo;s <em>own</em> logotype before. Sure, it was set and displayed on nearly every shirt, but it was different everytime. While that still works sometimes, we wanted a default logotype to use for those instances in which it was necessary. Ryan, the owner, and I decided on a hand&dash;drawn script. After a few hours, a lot of doodling, and a few tweaks, the Sweet Sauce script logo was born.</p>

<h4>The Mark</h4>
<p>The Sweet Sauce robot is something Ryan has been drawing and incorporating into Sweet Sauce since it&rsquo;s inception (according to him, even before that). Naturally, it was something he wanted to keep around. When he was upgraded to version 2.0, he gained a sharp pixel edge. Still, he doesn&rsquo;t clash with the more natural script.</p>

<h4>The Clothing</h4>
<p>Sweet Sauce is, after all, a clothing company. Here are a few shirt and sweater designs I&rsquo;ve created for the company. You can always view people actually wearing the shirts and so much more on Sweet Sauce&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.instagram.com/ilovesweetsauce" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.</p>
