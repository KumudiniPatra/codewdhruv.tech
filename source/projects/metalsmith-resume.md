I have used many tools to create résumés, but none ever felt right. Adobe InDesign is great at layout, but not great at maintaining content; Microsoft Word is a world-class content editor, but isn't too hot at layout. When it came time for me to update mine, I decided to use the best content editing & layout engines I could find: Markdown & CSS.
