[Lenny's Burger](http://lennysburger.com/) is a chain of hamburger restaurants local to Phoenix, Arizona. When I had a few projects across classes line up, I decided to use a prospective rebrand of Lenny's across all of them.

## A Return to Form

A large part of the reason I chose to rebrand Lenny's is because they make delicious food. Another big reason was that they had recently took their brand in what I felt was the wrong direction. This gave me a reason to reverse that, while introducing increased consistency and personality into the brand.

The mark is where this return is most obviously reflected: using [Sverige Script](http://www.aringtypeface.com/sverige-script/) by Aring Typeface as a baseline, I created a thick, flowing wordmark that harkens back to the original. I complimented the mark with Futura, and a color scheme that references the classic American hamburger joint.

## Inspired, Not Constrained

The mark, color palette, and typeface choices all were in service of creating a holistic, diner-inspired brand. However, this does not mean the brand could not also present a sense of _modernity_. I expressed this modernity by using large swaths of flat colors; big, bold typography; and tongue-in-cheek copywriting.

## A Brand That Sizzles

Of course, modernity in print is only _so_ modern. A truly modern brand is expressed interactively. As part of this project, I designed & developed a full, working website (including a rudimentary ordering system). I also used Quartz Composer to create a fully interactive dashboard for customers to control the jukebox, place their order, and learn about Lenny's.

Unfortunately, I have lost the source files for both of these projects and only have static mocks. This makes me very sad, but also slightly relieved. I am absolutely positive the code quality of both projects would have been abysmal.
