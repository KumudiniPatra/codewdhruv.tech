# Heading 1

But where did the lighter fluid come from? They want to break his legs. It's a good thing he's already got that little scooter. Annyong.

## Heading 2

I need a fake passport, preferably to France… I like the way they think. Popcorn shrimp… with club sauce.

### Heading 3

Buster's in what we like to call a light to no coma. In laymans terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it! But anyhoo, can you believe that the only reason the club is going under is because it's in a terrifying neighborhood? They're not gonna strip, right? I told them not to, but I can't guarantee their instincts won't kick in.

#### Heading 4

* List item
* Another one
* I think three's enough

##### Heading 5

2. Are
3. I don't know, kind of boring

I'm an ideas man, Michael. I think I proved that with `Fuck Mountain`. I was once called the worst audience participant _Cirque du Soleil_ ever had. Speaking of settling, how's Ann? **Never once** touched my per diem. I'd go to Craft Service, get some raw veggies, bacon, Cup-A-Soup…baby, [I got a stew goin'](http://google.com). I'll sacrifice anything for my children.

  'class',
  'names'

function setBg (el) {
  var newBg = backgrounds[Math.floor(Math.random() * backgrounds.length)]
  el.classList.add(newBg)

  var index = backgrounds.indexOf(currentBg)
  el.classList.remove(backgrounds[index])

> And don't make the water too hot. The scabs come right off. No, Pop-pop does not get a treat, I just brought you a [bleep]ing pizza. The CIA should've just Googled for his hideout, evidently. It's a _jetpack_, Michael. What could go wrong? Well, they got the Asian right… "hotties" might be a stretch. I'm a complete failure. I can't even fake the death of a stripper. Up yours, granny! You couldn't handle it!
