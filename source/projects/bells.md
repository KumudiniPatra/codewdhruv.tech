[Bell's Brewery](http://bellsbeer.com) is a brewer of craft beers from Kalamazoo, Michigan. As part of a student project, I rebranded the company and 6 of their most popular year-round brews. If you've never had a Two-Hearted Ale, you're missing out.

I wanted to create an icon that would be immediately recognizable if used without the logotype. After many, many sketches I landed on what I call the "mitten-bell". Incorporating Michigan's highly recognizable eastern coastline, the logo is both simple and iconic. (As an aside, I regrettably could not find a way to incorporate the Upper Peninsula, but not for lack of trying). The logotype is based on Lost Type's [Geared Slab](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=geared), with the slabs being reshaped to match the shape of the mitten-bell.
