[Bell's Brewery](http://bellsbeer.com) is a brewer of craft beers from Kalamazoo, Michigan. As part of a student project, I rebranded the company and 6 of their most popular year-round brews. If you've never had a Two-Hearted Ale, you're missing out.

I wanted to create an icon that would be immediately recognizable if used without the logotype. After many, many sketches I landed on what I call the "mitten-bell". Incorporating Michigan's highly recognizable eastern coastline, the logo is both simple and iconic. (As an aside, I regrettably could not find a way to incorporate the Upper Peninsula, but not for lack of trying). The logotype is based on Lost Type's [Geared Slab](http://www.losttype.com/font/?name=geared), with the slabs being reshaped to match the shape of the mitten-bell.

Bell's current packaging leverages unique artwork from around Kalamazoo per brew. While this has it's charms, it creates a wildly inconsistent look. One of my goals with this prospective rebrand was to create a more unified look across the packaging system. I started with some baseline constraints: one spot color per-brew, always incorporate the mitten-bell, use the same line-weight for each illustration. These constraints allowed each brew to retain a unique visual identity while still remaining within the system.

The last major piece of Bell's that needed updating was the website. The current website has a lot of focus on local events, and making that more prominent while increasing legibility was my main focus.
