Almost as soon as I finished [the previous version of this site](http://576f15a6d6865d23c5338933--lowmess.netlify.com/), I wanted to rebuild. Part of it was aesthetics; part of it was increasing performance, accessibility, and development experience; part of it was the undying itch of designers & developers everywhere to immediately refactor.

And, umm... I did it. This is it. You're on it literally right now.

## This Machine Runs on Open Source

This website would have been much harder to create if not for the maintainers, contributors, and other users of many open source projects, including the following:

* [Metalsmith](http://metalsmith.io)
* [Markdown-It](https://markdown-it.github.io/)
* [Pug](https://pugjs.org)
* [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
* [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/)
* [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
* [Hero Patterns](http://heropatterns.com)

This machine also _is_ open source, so you can see [the full dependency list](https://github.com/lowmess/lowmess/blob/develop/package.json), and, well, [anything else you want to](https://github.com/lowmess/lowmess).
