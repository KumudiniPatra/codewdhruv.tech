I'm a frontend developer & designer, with a passion for legibility, performance, and the open web. A quick learner with a thirst for knowledge. Enthusiastic and hard-working, I pride myself on my attention to detail.

That's what the intro on [my résumé](https://resume.lowmess.com) says. Kind of boring, huh? Well, it's a résumé. They're supposed to be boring. (Don't be such a nitpicker.)

Here's the fun stuff: my name _technically_ isn't Alec (don't worry about it); I'm fully convinced I could survive on burritos alone; and my favorite beer is all of them. If you have any questions, I'm happy to send you a non sequitur and/or fully-serious response if you [email me](mailto:alec@lowmess.com).
